# Jakarta Migration MCP Rules

## Environment Standards
- Always use **Gradle** on Windows (`gradlew.bat`) and **Mill** on Linux/macOS.
- **Mise** is the preferred task runner. Use `mise run <task>` (build, test, run, assembly, clean).
- On Windows, always run `.\scripts\kill-gradle-java.ps1` before rebuilds or if file lock issues occur (use `-Force` for persistent locks).

## Java Standards
- Use **Java 21**.
- Java home on Windows: `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21.0.10` (or as set in `gradle.properties`).

## Development Workflow
- For MCP Stdio transport, ensure nothing but JSON-RPC goes to stdout. All logs should go to stderr.
- When fixing tests, if a hang occurs, check if `java` is in the PATH or use absolute paths from `java.home`.
