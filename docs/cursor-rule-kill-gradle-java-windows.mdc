# Windows: Kill Gradle / Java before rebuild or retest

On Windows, Gradle daemons and leftover Java processes (tests, bootRun) can lock the filesystem and cause "file is in use" or daemon conflicts when rebuilding or re-running tests.

**Before rebuild or retest** (or when the user reports file locks), stop them:

- **Daemons only (safe, try first):**
  - `.\scripts\kill-gradle-java.ps1`
  - or: `mise run kill-gradle-java`

- **Daemons + Gradle/project Java (when locks persist):**
  - `.\scripts\kill-gradle-java.ps1 -Force` or `mise run kill-gradle-java-force`
  - This kills only Gradle daemons/workers and this project's JAR processes; it does not kill the IDE Java language server.

When suggesting rebuilds or test runs on Windows, suggest running the kill script first if the user has had lock issues or is doing a clean rebuild.
