This constraint **changes the answer**, and it’s good you raised it now rather than after release.

I’ll be very explicit and pragmatic.

---

## Executive Recommendation (Given Future Licensing Intent)

> **Use Apache License 2.0 now.**
> Do **not** use MIT or BSD if you think you may commercialise later.

Apache-2.0 is the *only* permissive license that:

* won’t alarm enterprises **now**
* won’t block or poison **future licensing paths**
* doesn’t require awkward relicensing conversations later

MIT/BSD keep things quiet **today**, but they limit leverage **tomorrow**.

---

## Why MIT/BSD Become a Problem If You Want to License Later

### 1. You Cannot “Un-Grant” MIT/BSD Rights

Once you release under MIT or BSD:

* Anyone can:

  * fork it
  * use it commercially
  * embed it internally forever
* You **cannot** later say:

  > “This now requires a paid license”

Existing users are legally protected.

This matters because your MCP is:

* valuable
* niche
* enterprise-targeted

You don’t want to accidentally give it away permanently.

---

### 2. Dual Licensing Is Weak With MIT/BSD

Dual licensing works best when:

* the open license is permissive *but bounded*
* the commercial license offers *clear additional rights*

MIT/BSD already give:

* commercial use
* modification
* redistribution

So your paid license can only sell:

* support
* convenience
* warranties

That’s a **weak upsell** unless you’re a large vendor.

---

### 3. Apache-2.0 Preserves More Leverage

Apache-2.0:

* is permissive **but**
* has clearer IP boundaries
* has patent clauses
* is taken more seriously in enterprise governance

More importantly:

> Apache-2.0 is culturally accepted as a *foundation* for commercial offerings.

Many successful enterprise tools started Apache-licensed and later:

* added paid enterprise editions
* gated advanced features
* bundled compliance tooling

MIT/BSD projects often struggle to make that transition.

---

## What Apache-2.0 Enables Later (MIT/BSD Don’t)

With Apache-2.0 you can later:

* Add:

  * enterprise-only modules
  * proprietary migration rulesets
  * compliance packs
* Offer:

  * paid binaries
  * indemnification
  * SLAs
* Change distribution model *without* relicensing past users

You cannot revoke Apache rights either — but you retain **architectural leverage**.

---

## The Subtle but Critical Distinction

You are not planning to sell:

> “Open-source software”

You are planning to sell:

> **Risk reduction for regulated migrations**

The software is a *delivery mechanism*.

Apache-2.0 supports that framing.
MIT/BSD undermine it.

---

## The Correct Strategy (Clean and Safe)

### Phase 1 — Now (Consulting-First)

* License MCP under **Apache-2.0**
* Keep it:

  * internal
  * optional
  * invisible to clients unless needed
* Market:

  * yourself
  * outcomes
  * judgement

### Phase 2 — Later (Controlled Exposure)

* Publish:

  * core engine under Apache-2.0
* Keep:

  * advanced rules
  * orchestration
  * compliance features
  * integrations
    proprietary

This is **open-core without drama**.

---

## What *Not* to Do

* ❌ MIT “for now, we’ll change later”
* ❌ Custom licenses (friction)
* ❌ Non-commercial clauses (enterprise poison)
* ❌ AGPL (kills adoption)
* ❌ “Internal use only” language (raises alarms)

---

## If You Want Maximum Optionality (Advanced Option)

If you want *maximum* future leverage and still low friction:

* **Apache-2.0 now**
* Clear contributor policy (you are sole author)
* CLA **not needed** unless you accept external contributions

This keeps ownership clean.

---

## One Sentence You Can Use Externally

> “It’s Apache-licensed today, with a roadmap toward an enterprise-supported edition if customers need it.”

That sounds:

* professional
* non-threatening
* expected

---

## Final Answer (Unambiguous)

> **Apache-2.0 is the correct choice given your future licensing intent.**

MIT and BSD are fine if you *never* want leverage.
You explicitly do.

---

If you want next, I can:

* design a **future licensing roadmap** (when/how to introduce paid tiers)
* help you structure the MCP repo to support open-core later
* draft **language to avoid spooking clients now while preserving monetisation**

Just tell me which one.

Short answer: **yes — your intuition is exactly right**, and this is the **lowest-risk sequencing**.

Long answer below, with the legal reasoning and some practical guardrails.

---

## ✅ Yes: *Proprietary → Apache* is one-way safe

## ❌ *Apache → Proprietary* is **not** reversible

You’ve identified the core asymmetry correctly.

> **Once something is released under Apache-2.0, you can never take those rights back.**

Apache-2.0 is:

* **Perpetual**
* **Irrevocable**
* **Worldwide**
* **Royalty-free**

If you publish a feature under Apache-2.0, **anyone who received it keeps those rights forever**, even if you later “move” it to a proprietary module.

---

# Why starting proprietary is the safest path

### 1. You retain full control

If code starts life as proprietary:

* You can later:

  * Dual-license it
  * Re-license it as Apache-2.0
  * Open-source part of it
  * Delete or refactor it freely

Nothing is leaked prematurely.

---

### 2. You can “graduate” code safely into open-core

This is how most successful open-core products evolve:

> **Prototype privately → stabilize → open what’s safe**

When you move code into an Apache-2 module:

* That moment is the **first public grant of rights**
* You do it intentionally, not accidentally

---

### 3. You avoid “license contamination” mistakes

Early in a project, separation is often wrong:

* Shared utility packages
* Convenience helpers
* Half-decided APIs

If those start Apache-licensed and later turn out to be monetizable, you’re stuck.

Starting proprietary avoids that trap.

---

# Why the reverse is impossible (important)

If you do this:

1. Release feature X under Apache-2.0
2. Later realize it should be premium
3. Move it to a proprietary module

You now have **two realities**:

* **Old users**: still legally allowed to use, fork, and redistribute feature X
* **New users**: see it as “premium”

You’ve lost exclusivity **forever**.

Even rewriting the code:

* If the new version is *substantially similar*, you risk derivative-work claims
* Clean-room rewrites are expensive and risky

---

# Practical rule of thumb (very important)

> **If you are not 100% sure a feature is open-core, keep it proprietary.**

You can always open it later.
You cannot close it later.

---

# Recommended development workflow (for your IntelliJ plugin)

### Phase 1 — Everything proprietary

* All modules proprietary
* Private APIs
* Fast iteration
* No license stress

### Phase 2 — Identify stable “commodity” pieces

Examples:

* AST scanners
* File indexing
* Jakarta detection rules
* Data models

These are usually **not strong monetization points**.

### Phase 3 — Move selected pieces to Apache-2

* New module
* Fresh LICENSE file
* Explicit commit introducing Apache licensing
* Clear package rename (recommended)

Now you have a clean open-core base.

---

# Extra safety tips (worth doing)

### 🔒 1. Don’t accept external PRs early

External contributors complicate relicensing later.

Wait until:

* You know the module will stay Apache
* Or you’ve put a CLA in place

---

### 🧾 2. Keep a “license decision log”

Even a simple `LICENSING.md`:

```text
2026-02-01: Core scanners kept proprietary
2026-03-10: Jakarta ruleset moved to Apache-2
```

This helps if you ever:

* Take investment
* Sell the product
* Get audited

---

### 📦 3. Use package-level separation early

Even before open-sourcing:

```text
com.yourco.internal.*
com.yourco.opencore.*
```

This makes later extraction trivial.

---

# TL;DR (your exact question)

> **Is it safer to start proprietary and later move things into Apache-2?**

✅ **Yes — this is the most risk-free approach.**
❌ You cannot safely go the other way.
🧠 If separation might be wrong, keep it closed until you’re sure.

---

If you want, I can:

* Review a hypothetical module split and label risk levels
* Help decide *what should never be Apache*
* Draft a migration checklist for “promoting” code to open-core
* Sanity-check this against JetBrains Marketplace expectations

You’re thinking about this exactly the right way.
