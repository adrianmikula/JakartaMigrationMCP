description: Prefer mise run over direct mill/gradle for Java build tasks

# Prefer mise commands

When suggesting or running Java build, test, run, assembly, or clean:

- **Prefer** `mise run <task>` over direct `mill` or `gradlew` invocations.
- Mise picks the right tool (Mill on Linux/macOS, Gradle on Windows) and uses the project’s pinned versions.

**Preferred:**

```bash
mise run build      # compile
mise run test       # run tests
mise run run        # run the app
mise run assembly   # build fat JAR
mise run clean      # clean artifacts
```

**Fallback** (only when mise is unavailable or the user asks for raw commands): use `mill jakartaMigrationMcp.<task>` on Linux/macOS or `.\gradlew.bat <task>` on Windows.
